SQL injection


Identify a Target Website: Look for websites that are potentially vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. These are often websites that have dynamic content and interact with a backend database.

Analyze the Target: Use tools like SQLMap, Burp Suite, or manual inspection to identify potential injection points on the target website. Look for input fields, such as login forms or search bars, where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

Test the Payloads: Use the crafted payloads to test the injection points on the target website. Observe the website's response to determine if the payloads are successful in extracting information from the database.

Extract Sensitive Information: If successful, extract and analyze the sensitive information obtained from the database. This may include user credentials, personal data, or other sensitive records.

Please note that conducting SQL injection attacks against websites without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before attempting any security testing on a website or web application.
